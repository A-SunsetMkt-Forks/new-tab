## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2018-02-04

### Added

- Now published on the Google Chrome web store: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab/cpcibnbdmpmcmnkhoiilpnlaepkepknb>.
- Search now also finds matches in your browsing history.
- Subtle shadows to show depth and highlight areas of interest.
- New menu items and menu open animation.
- Listen to tab events and update tabs list when something changes.
- Show message when there are no matching search results for a category.
- Wrote a better readme.

### Fixed

- Bookmark folders open to the right if there's not enough space to show the folder in the window.
- Debounce search input to help prevent layout thrashing when search results appear.
- Add `title` attribute to bookmarks to view long bookmark titles on hover.

### Changed

- Renamed all files and directories for consistency.
- A more logical file layout including most Marko components as single files rather than directories with multiple files.
- Better build flow.
- Performance improvements:
  - Inline CSS in HTML + add minimal page markup to template for near-instant initial page load.
  - Better minification in builds â€” even though Chrome extensions serve local files from the filesystem, minification still improves browser parsing times.
  - Short CSS classes for faster DOM parsing and matching.
  - Set many elements as `no-update` for much faster Marko rendering passes.
  - Use `key` on repeating elements for faster rendering when elements move in the DOM (e.g. during search/filtering).
- Clean up, improve, and move build scripts into `/build`.

### Removed

- Dependency `fast-memoize` as the benefit was not really there.

## 0.1.0 - 2018-01-25

### Added

- Initial public version including all the basics; working proof of concept code, readme, etc. Not ready for release yet though, it's still far from being actually useful!
