# New Tab

A high performance new tab page that gets you where you need to go faster. Utilises the latest tools and tech, packaged into a Google Chrome extension.

[![Add to Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/images/ChromeWebStore_Badge_v2_340x96.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab/cpcibnbdmpmcmnkhoiilpnlaepkepknb)

## Overview

I was left frustrated by the default Google Chrome new tab page experience. The "top sites" feature quickly outgrew its usefulness and I found myself using bookmarks instead every time. I never used the Google web search input either, as the search bar is all I need. I wondered... "If I could design my own new tab what would it look like?"... enter the `New Tab` extension.

Originally an experimental project to give me a chance for me to play with the Chrome browser APIs and explore web performance optimisations. This grew into something that actually improved my productivity and so, now `New Tab` is available for anyone to use.

### Features

* Minimal design aesthetic with multiple theme.
* See a list of your open tabs.
* Quickly search open tabs, bookmarks, and history in one place.
* Simple bookmarks bar.
* Links to common places in your browser.

### Motives

Issue | Why / How
--|--
Access | Still have access to common things like the bookmarks bar<sup>[*1](#known-issues)</sup> etc.
Speed | Near instant access to functionality. Page load performance, runtime performance, and file size should all be scrupulously optimised.
Privacy | No user tracking scripts (unlike most other extensions). Errors are tracked by default but you can easily opt-out.
Unobtrusive | No annoying things like entries in your right click menu.

### Technology

* [Marko](https://markojs.com) JavaScript framework
* [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/)
* [Lasso](https://github.com/lasso-js/lasso) resource bundler
* [Chrome browser APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/api_index)

## Known issues

1. No overflow menu on the bookmarks bar. I haven't been able to implement this with the level performance I'm after from the extension so this is purposely left out.
    * _Workaround:_ Limit the number of bookmarks in your bookmarks bar folder or group your bookmarks into folders (it's nice to have it clean and minimal anyway!).
1. The extension's bookmarks bar is lacking in functionality. Chrome doesn't have an API to control the native bookmarks bar via extensions so I've recreated a simplistic version. The goal here is _high performance_ and not to emulate all the native bookmarks bar features.
1. Page needs to be reload after adding, editing, or removing bookmarks. Because bookmarks don't change often, I prefer not to add bookmark event listeners as most users simply don't need live bookmark changes.
1. Searching the browsing history is slow when you history is _very_ big. This is just a reality of Chrome. ðŸ˜¢

## Browser support

Each release will support the 2 latest versions of Google Chrome.

## Bugs

Please report any bugs you encounter on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/MaxMilton/new-tab/issues). Feature requests are welcome but keep in mind the goal is to keep things quite minimal and fast.
