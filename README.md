# New Tab ![](./static/icon48.png)

A high performance browser new tab page that gets you where you need to go faster. Utilises the latest tools and tech, packaged into an easy to use Chrome browser extension.

## Overview

I was left frustrated by the default Google Chrome new tab page experience. The "top sites" feature quickly outgrew its usefulness and I found myself using bookmarks instead every time. I never used the Google web search input either, as the search bar is all I need. I wondered... "If I could design my own new tab what would it look like?"... enter the `New Tab` extension.

Originally an experimental project to give me a chance for me to play with the Chrome browser APIs and explore web performance optimisations. It grew into something that actually improved my productivity and so, now `New Tab` is available for anyone to use.

### Features

- Fastest loading of any new tab page with all the features you expect.
- Distraction-free, minimal design aesthetic with multiple themes.
- List of your open tabs, recently closed tabs, and top sites.
- Search tabs, bookmarks, history, and top sites in one place.
- Simple bookmarks bar.
- Links to common places in your browser.

### Design goals

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Issue | Why / How |
| --- | --- |
| Access | Still have access to common things like the bookmarks bar etc. |
| Speed | Near-instant access to functionality. Page load performance, runtime performance, and file size should all be scrupulously optimised. |
| Privacy & Security | Zero user tracking (unlike most other extensions!). Very restrictive [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP). Local data only; no remote data fetching. |
| Unobtrusive | No annoying things like distracting colours, illegible text, or entries in your right click menu. |

### Technology

- [Chrome browser APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/)
- [stage1](https://github.com/maxmilton/stage1) JavaScript framework
- [ekscss](https://github.com/maxmilton/ekscss) style preprocessor
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) JavaScript bundler

## Browser support

Recent versions of Google Chrome and other Chromium based browsers (e.g., Brave, Edge).

## Bugs

Please report any bugs you encounter on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/maxmilton/new-tab/issues).

### Known issues

1. The extension's bookmarks bar functionality is limited. Chrome doesn't allow extensions to control the native bookmarks bar visibility so I've recreated a simple version. The goal is _high performance_ and quick access rather than trying to emulate the native bookmarks bar. Use the bookmark manager for access to all features.
1. Page needs to be reloaded after adding, editing, or removing bookmarks. Bookmarks don't change often, so changes are not live.
1. The project is set up for development on Linux and may not build on other operating systems.
